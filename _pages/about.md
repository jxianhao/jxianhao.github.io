This is Xianhao Jin's personal website. I was a Ph.D. student at [Virgina Tech](https://vt.edu/), under the supervision of [Dr. Francisco Servant](https://fservant.github.io/). I pursued my Ph.D. degree in May 2022 and became a software engineer of backend and infrastructure. My main research interest focuses on mining software repositories and software engineering empirical studies. Check out [my CV](https://jxianhao.github.io/files/CV.pdf) here.
